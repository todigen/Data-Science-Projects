### summary

* <ins>Customer_Churn_Prediction</ins>: Kaggle competition about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning". The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. The evaluation metric for this competition is the test accuracy and the test set submissions are evaluated using the test Accuracy criterion.

* <ins>Rain_in_Australia</ins>: Data analysis and model production of a Kaggle dataset containing about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. The context is to predict next-day rain in Australia by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow. Data insights and correlations between the climatic event, time series and physical features are derived. Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations.

* <ins>Neural_Academy_Final_Project</ins>: The project consists of exploratory data analysis and modeling using custom transformers and data pipelines. The problem consists in a binary classification to predict the state of a machine (0 or 1). For this dataset of 900,000 samples, feature engineering plays an important role in the outcome of the performance.
