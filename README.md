### summary

* <ins>Customer_Churn_Prediction</ins>: Kaggle competition about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning". The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. The evaluation metric for this competition is the test accuracy and the test set submissions are evaluated using the test Accuracy criterion.

* <ins>Rain_in_Australia</ins>: Data analysis and model production of a Kaggle dataset containing about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. The task is to predict next-day rain in Australia by training classification models on the target variable "RainTomorrow". Data insights and correlations between the climatic event, time series and physical features are derived. Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations.

* <ins>Neural_Academy_Final_Project</ins>: The project consists of exploratory data analysis and modeling using custom transformers and data pipelines. The problem consists in a binary classification to predict the state of a machine (0 or 1). For this training dataset of 900,000 samples, feature engineering plays an important role in the outcome of the performance.

* <ins>Weather_Image_Recognition</ins>: In this Computer Vision project a pre-trained neural network is used to built a CNN model for multiclass classification of 11 different categories of weather images using transfer learning with fine tuning technique. The dataset (11 directories) contains labeled 6862 images of different types of weather [[Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset)]


* <ins>minor_projects</ins>: My first Python programs about ROC and PR curves and kNN (k-nearest neighbors) model implementation.
